# Description
This is an introductory data visualization project, based on a kaggle traffic violation dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubamsumbria/traffic-violations-dataset). The project is made in kivy which is a cross platform open source python framework for NUI developement and every button is carefully handcrafted in Paint3D. The final outcome is a small application, showing heatmaps with some additional features. For your own good please don't change the size of the window because it's not designed that way.


To run this application:
- Download the *datavis* folder.
- *cd* into the folder.
- Use *python adatviz_ui.py* command. (Additional mdules are required)

By pressing the button at the top right corner with the question mark, you can get additional information about the widgets found on the current page.  Press it again to hide the information panel.  

In the *traffic.ipynb* you can find the code I extracted the data with, the *traffic.html* is the same file saved in an html format.
